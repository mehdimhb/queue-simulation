# Queue Simulation

Queue Simulation Project is a versatile platform designed to replicate and analyze a wide range of real-world waiting scenarios. With its diverse settings and parameters, this project provides an environment to investigate and optimize queue-based systems across various domains. From understanding customer wait times in call centers to streamlining manufacturing processes and even optimizing traffic flow in urban planning, the applications of queue simulation are extensive.

Queue Simulation is available online at [Queue Simulation](https://queue-simulation.streamlit.app/)

## Installation and Usage

To run Queue Simulation locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mehdimhb/queue-simulation.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd queue-simulation
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the Streamlit app:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

The application should now be accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

Once you have the application running, you can use it to simulate queues and see result and statistics. Feel free to explore various parameters and customize settings and run the simulations according to your specific needs.
